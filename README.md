## General Information
The Hi-Lo Equation introduces a gaming concept wherein players employ numerical cards and arithmetic operations to formulate equations that approximate the values of 1 or 20. Through strategic employment of mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and even square roots—players craft an equation approaching the chosen target value. This program will analyze the game mechanics with discrete mathematical concepts, particularly combinatorics and tree, to breakdown the optimal outcomes based on card distribution among players, thereby refining their gameplay strategies.

## Technologies Used
- C++

### Dependencies
- C/C++ Compiler
